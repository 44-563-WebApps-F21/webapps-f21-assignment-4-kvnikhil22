<p>
MRS. MARCHMONT. <br>
 Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?<br>

LADY BASILDON. <br>
 I suppose so.  Are you?<br>

MRS. MARCHMONT.<br>
  Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?<br>

LADY BASILDON.  <br>
Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
go anywhere.<br>

MRS. MARCHMONT.<br>
  I come here to be educated.<br>

LADY BASILDON. <br>
 Ah! I hate being educated!<br>

 MRS. MARCHMONT. <br>
  How very trivial of him!<br>

LADY BASILDON. <br>
 Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?<br>

MRS. MARCHMONT. <br>
 About myself.<br>

LADY BASILDON. <br>
 [_Languidly_.]  And were you interested?<br>

MRS. MARCHMONT.<br>
  [_Shaking her head_.]  Not in the smallest degree.<br>
